. . . Develop a “bank account” program. The program keeps
track of the balances in a person’s bank accounts. Each account
has an id number and a customer’s name. There are three kinds
of accounts: a checking account, a savings account, and a cer￾tificate of deposit 
(CD). 
Checking account information also in￾cludes the minimum balance. 
Savings account includes the in￾terest rate. 
A CD specifies the interest rate and the maturity
date. Naturally, all three types come with a current balance. . . .
Represent the following examples using your classes
