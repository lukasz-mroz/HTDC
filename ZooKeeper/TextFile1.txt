. . . Develop a program that helps a zoo keeper take care ofthe animals in the zoo. For now the zoo has lions, snakes, andmonkeys. Every animal has a name and weight. The zoo keeperalso needs to know how much meat the lion eats per day, thelength of each snake, and the favorite food for each monkey.Examples:Lion John weights 100kg and eats 10kg meat per daySnake Ana weights 5kg and has 1meter long,Monkey Steve weights 30kg has banana as his favourite meal
